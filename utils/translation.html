Hi Deeraj,  

Regarding the attached public key, I would need to know whether it has already been uploaded to the production Secret Manager or if it will be uploaded in the next release.  

Thank you!

Regarding the technical account svc_8960FTRE and change request CHG5445656,

In order to write to the network folder \dbg.db.com\res_res via SFTP Composer, we need to:

Create an alias to enable writing to the network folder

Address the issue where we currently encounter an error when attempting to establish an SFTP connection

Let me know if you need any refinements
</pre>

Only after the previous DAG has finished running, trigger the following DAG: 125464-fsdfsd.

Hi Surendhar,

I just opened this SR (RITM54454) a little while ago to manually run the following DAGs:

Thank you!

Hi Igor,

Currently, the following folders are definitely not used by the transaction monitoring process:
/app.tr/uat
/app.tr/test

I still need to check the folders:
/app.tr/tmonitor (packed in a zip file)
/app.tr/bin

to confirm whether they are also unused by the process.
</pre>
<pre>
    Ok, thank you, Surendhar. You may now proceed with triggering DAG

    Hi Alexandru,

    The query performs a daily extraction directly from the t_trd_ana_ndg_glober table. Therefore, any changes to that table will impact the retrieved records.  Also, the number of records returned is affected by missing data in the UAT environment. There's no specific process for extracting only the delta."
</pre>
<pre>Yes, the scope of the position file is the same as that of the counterparty query.</pre>

Hi Alexandru,

The issue we're seeing might be specific to the UAT environment, as the 'missing' field seems to be First_name.

In production, the person's first and last names are separated by a plus sign (+). However, in UAT, due to data masking, this separation doesn't occur, and the names appear as a single string. This could be why the split operation isn't working correctly.

We can modify the query to try and handle this specific scenario.

Hi Surendhar,
Yesterday I opened SR RTI353454 to request the pause of the following DAG:
124324 fdsfdsfds
We need it to be paused before the automatic run scheduled for tomorrow.
Could you please take care of it?
</pre>

<pre>
Hi Surendhar,
Yesterday I opened SR RIT5454 with a request to trigger the following DAG in production:
125974 fsfdsfs
Could you please proceed with this when possible?
</pre>
<pre>
Hi Alexandru,
Iâ€™ve updated the query to address the issue related to splitting the First_name and Last_name fields.
The file was sent this morning via DBExchange UAT and includes all 18 expected fields.
</pre>

<pre>
    The name you provided does not match any report I have managed.
    It's not a report that I was involved with.

Hi Igor,
I tried testing the new workflow, but it seems that the modified files in the repository are not being updated.
This issue occurs for both transaction-monitoring and app-reporting-python.
The modified files are not being reflected in the bucket.

For example:

For transaction-monitoring: gs://fsdfdsfsdds

For reporting-python: gs://fsdfdsfsdds
