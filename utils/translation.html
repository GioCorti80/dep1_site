Hi Deeraj,  

Regarding the attached public key, I would need to know whether it has already been uploaded to the production Secret Manager or if it will be uploaded in the next release.  

Thank you!
</pre>
<pre>
Regarding the technical account svc_8960FTRE and change request CHG5445656,

In order to write to the network folder \dbg.db.com\res_res via SFTP Composer, we need to:

Create an alias to enable writing to the network folder

Address the issue where we currently encounter an error when attempting to establish an SFTP connection

Let me know if you need any refinements
</pre>

Only after the previous DAG has finished running, trigger the following DAG: 125464-fsdfsd.

Hi Surendhar,

I just opened this SR (RITM54454) a little while ago to manually run the following DAGs:

Thank you!
</pre>

<pre>
Hi Igor,

Currently, the following folders are definitely not used by the transaction monitoring process:
/app.tr/uat
/app.tr/test

I still need to check the folders:
/app.tr/tmonitor (packed in a zip file)
/app.tr/bin

to confirm whether they are also unused by the process.
</pre>
<pre>
    Ok, thank you, Surendhar. You may now proceed with triggering DAG
</pre>
<pre>
    Hi Alexandru,

    The query performs a daily extraction directly from the t_trd_ana_ndg_glober table. Therefore, any changes to that table will impact the retrieved records.  Also, the number of records returned is affected by missing data in the UAT environment. There's no specific process for extracting only the delta."
</pre>
<pre>Yes, the scope of the position file is the same as that of the counterparty query.</pre>

<pre>
Hi Alexandru,

The issue we're seeing might be specific to the UAT environment, as the 'missing' field seems to be First_name.

In production, the person's first and last names are separated by a plus sign (+). However, in UAT, due to data masking, this separation doesn't occur, and the names appear as a single string. This could be why the split operation isn't working correctly.

We can modify the query to try and handle this specific scenario.
</pre>
<pre>
Hi Surendhar,
Yesterday I opened SR RTI353454 to request the pause of the following DAG:
124324 fdsfdsfds
We need it to be paused before the automatic run scheduled for tomorrow.
Could you please take care of it?
</pre>

<pre>
Hi Surendhar,
Yesterday I opened SR RIT5454 with a request to trigger the following DAG in production:
125974 fsfdsfs
Could you please proceed with this when possible?
</pre>
<pre>
Hi Alexandru,
I’ve updated the query to address the issue related to splitting the First_name and Last_name fields.
The file was sent this morning via DBExchange UAT and includes all 18 expected fields.
</pre>

<pre>
    The name you provided does not match any report I have managed.
    It's not a report that I was involved with.
</pre>
<pre>
Hi Igor,
I tried testing the new workflow, but it seems that the modified files in the repository are not being updated.
This issue occurs for both transaction-monitoring and app-reporting-python.
The modified files are not being reflected in the bucket.

For example:

For transaction-monitoring: gs://fsdfdsfsdds

For reporting-python: gs://fsdfdsfsdds
</pre>
<pre>
Hi Igor,
Alright, the branch for transaction-monitoring has already been merged into RELEASE_dbc_dev.
I’ve checked the files in the reporting-python bucket, and they’re now updated and aligned with the repository.
I’m now proceeding with the deployment of the transaction-monitoring dev branch.
</pre>
<pre>
Hi Janani,
I’ve prepared the following PR for reporting-engine, which includes updates to both report_list_engine and reporting_mandatory.xlsx.
It has now been approved for dev, and I’ve also raised the PR for UAT.

<pre>
Hi Alexandru,
I'm attaching to this email the extraction from UAT, which contains some data.
We've also sent the GPG file via DBExchange.

Hi Surendhar,
I've opened SR RIT2423432 to request the unpause of the following DAG:
125479 Transaction Monitoring.
It should start automatically, but if it doesn’t, please trigger it manually.

ciao Alessandro,
non ho mai provato a recuperare file dalle cartelle di rete.
So che su alcune cartelle è possibile fare tasto-destro>proprietà e poi cliccare sul tab "versioni precedenti" però non sono sicuro che sia una funzione sempre attiva

<pre>
Hi Surendhar,
In relation to SR RIT23423 for transaction-monitoring, could you please trigger the following DAG?
12354 dag-persistent
with the following parameters:

This is to attempt recovery of the transaction-monitoring fin_instr task that failed due to resource issues.
</pre>
<pre>
lo storico dei file dovrebbe essere ancora presente sul bucket di produzione al quale però non avviamo accesso direttamente ed è necessario ottenere un'autorizzazione per poter scaricare i file. Puoi provare a chiedere ad Antonio Sannino
</pre>
<pre>
OK, thanks Surendhar.
Could you please mark the fin task of the transaction-monitoring DAG as Succeeded, so the DAG can continue with the next tasks?

The current query isn’t set up to retrieve data from previous days. I believe the request is about the possibility of downloading files from earlier extractions already stored in the bucket.

    Ciao Laura,
si tratta di un problema con la lettura del mapping specification
è stata aggiunta una riga che contiene la il testo b22 e pertanto c'è un problema nella lettura della tabelle specificatamente per questo report
Il problema non sarà risolvibile se non nella prossima release nel frattempo entro settimana prossima provo a verificare se riesco ad eseguire il run su awp ma il codice richiede un adattamento
Per evitare problemi in futuro
</pre>

Dear [Recipient],
Please find attached the final report of the Sigma Transaction Monitoring process.
The process concluded with the following status: HEALTH CHECK FAILED – file not uploaded.

Last year, DAG 125479 was created to upload tables to the Oracle staging area.
During the most recent run, it executed successfully, and I expect that the tables have been loaded.

The table b103_mm_priorira is no longer being updated, and the two models have been consolidated into the table b104_priorità.

The Assegni priorità table should have been populated correctly.
The tm_weekly_health_check is currently not included among the DAG’s tasks.

The DAG’s activity ends with loading the staging area and sending the OK files.
However, we do not have visibility into what happens within Oracle during the transition from the staging area to the Oracle tables. For this reason, I’ll need to follow up with Salvatore.
</pre>

Ciao Antonio Ho partecipato Ieri alla riunione di monitoring tool relativa però alla parte caricamenti 
Allo stato attuale ho accesso alla landing zone e al repository 
Da quello che ho capito La parte relativa alla reportistica dovrebbe partire dopo il caricamento dei databart 
Attualmente non mi è chiaro il meccanismo di deploit che viene utilizzato perché non vedo delle tag in composer 
Ho visto che sono presenti dalle Store procedurs i Bee query relativamente al caricamento delle tabelle 

attualmente non sono chiari i meccanismi di deploy

Hi everyone,
I’m running into an issue with these two PRs, specifically with the SLDC controls for the unit tests.

The view reported in the incidents refers to the new models implemented in 2024, with the upload process having commenced at the end of 2024. The corresponding BigQuery tables are as follows:
</pre>
<pre>
The staging area is populated via the trigger of the following DAG:
</pre>
<pre>
The table TM_WEEKLY_HEALTH_CHECK is not part of the Oracle staging area upload process.

The table b103_mm_priorita is no longer populated as it has been merged into b103_priorita.

The DT_RIF_BUSINESS column is not present in the BigQuery tables, which are instead partitioned by the DATA_RIF field. This column is created directly by the Control-M process on Oracle.
</pre>

Hi Hanumantha,

I've added comments to the two incidents regarding the issues users encountered with Oracle.

Hi Sattwik,
Unfortunately, I haven’t developed any jobs or applications so far that involve connecting Dataproc to on-prem Hive.
The connection string you used looks correct.

This is the connection string I usually used (only on on-prem EAP):
jdbcs:88fsfdsfsd
However, as I mentioned, I’ve never developed jobs that read data from Hive EAP through GCP Dataproc.

Buongiorno a tutti,
la presente per comunicare che nella prossima release (run monthly del 05/2025) nella mail finale sarà aggiunta l'informazione relativa all'upload del file su dbexchange.

Hey Surendhar,

I opened service request SR54545 a few days ago. Could you please put the following on hold until this month's release? This is to prevent it from running automatically.
</pre>
<pre>
On the development side, we can include the scheduling change in the next release on May 21st.
Currently, both reports are scheduled to run daily at 10 AM.
</pre>
<pre>
Hi Surendhar,
I’ve just opened service request RIT43243 to unpause the DAG 1235fd.
Could you please reactivate the DAG so it can run automatically today at 9 AM?
</pre>
<pre>
Ciao Antonio,
attualmente non ho ancora contattato Priyanka ho provato a fare alcuni test su log explorer per capire quali soluzioni potrebbero essere implementabili con l'utilizzo di python oppure soluzioni infrastrutturali nativa GCP con l'uso dei log_sink per l'esportazione dei log
A questo punto sarebbe utile schedulare una call per capire quale soluzione hanno scelto e che tipo di filtri inserire nella query su cloud log
</pre>
<pre>
Ok, thank you.
I was running some tests on Cloud Logging.
Do you have the name of the service account and the filters I should use to retrieve the relevant data from Cloud Logging?
Are the logs related to the project dretre-gdgfdgdf?

As a final output, are you expecting a BigQuery table or a file? And what information should we extract — only the queries, or is there additional data you would like us to retrieve?
</pre>
<pre>
Today, the monthly process ran: the table assegni_priorita was updated via the staging table stg_tm_priorita, and the file pwcfsfds.ok was sent.

Hi Prianka,

Okay, I'll be on today's call.

<pre>
Hi Hanumantha,
Yes, thank you. The end user would like the extraction to be relaunched using the new query after the release.

Hi Alexandru,
the DAGs are currently scheduled at 10 AM UTC with no dependencies on other pipelines.
From the next release, they’ll run at 10 AM UTC for counterparty and 11 AM UTC for position.
</pre>
<pre>
Hi Hanumantha,
For the TM process, we load data into the stg_tm_assegni_priorita table in the Oracle staging area.
</pre>
<pre>
The DAG is triggered by the Transaction Monitoring DAG, which has the triggering of the tm_oracle DAG as its final task.
</pre>
<pre>
Hi Tarun,
It’s not a process I’m familiar with. It seems more like something that falls under the responsibilities of a Business Analyst or someone involved in DWH table
</pre>
<pre>
Hi Alexandru,
The schedule you indicated works for me, so the DAGs will be scheduled as follows:

10 AM UTC for counterparty

11 AM UTC for position
</pre>
<pre>
Ciao Luca,
potrebbe essere schedulato per la prossima release che potrebbe essere all'inizio di giugno.
Trattandosi di un invio su cartella di rete bisognerebbe verificare se esistono già altri report gcp che vengono inviati a tale cartella.
In caso affermativo l'implementazione è veloce.
In caso contrario bisognerà verificare che esista già un account tecnico che può scrivere sulla cartella di rete (anche se non collegato a gcp) altrimenti bisogna crearlo. In quest'ultimo caso i tempi si potrebbero allungare.

Vedo però che la cartella è la stessa dell'id1901 e altri report quindi non è necessario fare altre operazioni.
Non sono sicuro che siamo ancora in tempo per la release del 21/05 pertanto potrebbe andare nella release di inizio giugno.

Ti faccio sapere.

Ciao.
