Hi Deeraj,  

Regarding the attached public key, I would need to know whether it has already been uploaded to the production Secret Manager or if it will be uploaded in the next release.  

Thank you!
</pre>
<pre>
Regarding the technical account svc_8960FTRE and change request CHG5445656,

In order to write to the network folder \dbg.db.com\res_res via SFTP Composer, we need to:

Create an alias to enable writing to the network folder

Address the issue where we currently encounter an error when attempting to establish an SFTP connection

Let me know if you need any refinements
</pre>

<pre>
Only after the previous DAG has finished running, trigger the following DAG: 125464-fsdfsd.
</pre>
<pre>
Hi Surendhar,

I just opened this SR (RITM54454) a little while ago to manually run the following DAGs:

Thank you!
</pre>

<pre>
Hi Igor,

Currently, the following folders are definitely not used by the transaction monitoring process:
/app.tr/uat
/app.tr/test

I still need to check the folders:
/app.tr/tmonitor (packed in a zip file)
/app.tr/bin

to confirm whether they are also unused by the process.
</pre>
<pre>
    Ok, thank you, Surendhar. You may now proceed with triggering DAG
</pre>

    Hi Alexandru,

    The query performs a daily extraction directly from the t_trd_ana_ndg_glober table. Therefore, any changes to that table will impact the retrieved records.  Also, the number of records returned is affected by missing data in the UAT environment. There's no specific process for extracting only the delta."
</pre>
<pre>Yes, the scope of the position file is the same as that of the counterparty query.</pre>

<pre>
Hi Alexandru,

The issue we're seeing might be specific to the UAT environment, as the 'missing' field seems to be First_name.

In production, the person's first and last names are separated by a plus sign (+). However, in UAT, due to data masking, this separation doesn't occur, and the names appear as a single string. This could be why the split operation isn't working correctly.

We can modify the query to try and handle this specific scenario.
</pre>

Hi Surendhar,
Yesterday I opened SR RTI353454 to request the pause of the following DAG:
124324 fdsfdsfds
We need it to be paused before the automatic run scheduled for tomorrow.
Could you please take care of it?
</pre>

<pre>
Hi Surendhar,
Yesterday I opened SR RIT5454 with a request to trigger the following DAG in production:
125974 fsfdsfs
Could you please proceed with this when possible?
</pre>
<pre>
Hi Alexandru,
I’ve updated the query to address the issue related to splitting the First_name and Last_name fields.
The file was sent this morning via DBExchange UAT and includes all 18 expected fields.
</pre>

<pre>
    The name you provided does not match any report I have managed.
    It's not a report that I was involved with.
</pre>
<pre>
Hi Igor,
I tried testing the new workflow, but it seems that the modified files in the repository are not being updated.
This issue occurs for both transaction-monitoring and app-reporting-python.
The modified files are not being reflected in the bucket.

For example:

For transaction-monitoring: gs://fsdfdsfsdds

For reporting-python: gs://fsdfdsfsdds
</pre>
<pre>
Hi Igor,
Alright, the branch for transaction-monitoring has already been merged into RELEASE_dbc_dev.
I’ve checked the files in the reporting-python bucket, and they’re now updated and aligned with the repository.
I’m now proceeding with the deployment of the transaction-monitoring dev branch.
</pre>
<pre>
Hi Janani,
I’ve prepared the following PR for reporting-engine, which includes updates to both report_list_engine and reporting_mandatory.xlsx.
It has now been approved for dev, and I’ve also raised the PR for UAT.
</pre>
<pre>
Hi Alexandru,
I'm attaching to this email the extraction from UAT, which contains some data.
We've also sent the GPG file via DBExchange.
</pre>
<pre>
Buongiorno
per poter eseguire l'implementazione su rotool della virtual-region il run del mese di aprile parità dopo la release prevista in data odierna.

Ciao.

In order to write via SFTP to the folder \\dbg\fsdsf\fgdf, we need to create an alias for the user svc_898989 that allows this technical user to write to the specified folder (ACL has already been assigned).
</pre>
<pre>
Could you please unpause the following DAG:

125479 Transaction Monitoring

The DAG should start automatically. If it doesn't, we kindly ask you to trigger it manually.
</pre>

<pre>
Hi Surendhar,
I've opened SR RIT2423432 to request the unpause of the following DAG:
125479 Transaction Monitoring.
It should start automatically, but if it doesn’t, please trigger it manually.
</pre>
<pre>
    Thanks, Surendhar. I’ll monitor the DAG this morning.
</pre>

git è purtroppo un software indispensabile per poter operare i rilasci e viene utilizzato in locale sul pc

Hi Surendhar,
Could you kindly share the Dataproc log for ID432 fsdfdsfdsfsfdsfsfsdds?
Thanks!
</pre>
<pre>
ciao Alessandro,
non ho mai provato a recuperare file dalle cartelle di rete.
So che su alcune cartelle è possibile fare tasto-destro>proprietà e poi cliccare sul tab "versioni precedenti" però non sono sicuro che sia una funzione sempre attiva
</pre>
<pre>
Hi Surendhar,
In relation to SR RIT23423 for transaction-monitoring, could you please trigger the following DAG?
12354 dag-persistent
with the following parameters:

This is to attempt recovery of the transaction-monitoring fin_instr task that failed due to resource issues.
</pre>
<pre>
lo storico dei file dovrebbe essere ancora presente sul bucket di produzione al quale però non avviamo accesso direttamente ed è necessario ottenere un'autorizzazione per poter scaricare i file. Puoi provare a chiedere ad Antonio Sannino
</pre>
<pre>
OK, thanks Surendhar.
Could you please mark the fin task of the transaction-monitoring DAG as Succeeded, so the DAG can continue with the next tasks?
</pre>
<pre>
gsutil ls gs://your-bucket-name/path/to/directory/Posizioni_202505*

The current query isn’t set up to retrieve data from previous days. I believe the request is about the possibility of downloading files from earlier extractions already stored in the bucket.
